Write code for the following questions:

1) Variable Assignment
Assign the value 5 to a variable and then copy that value to another variable before printing it, how would you write a Python code to achieve this? Your solution should involve creating two variables and ensuring the second variable displays the same value as the first when printed.

2) Data Types
What data type is the variable z if z = 3.5? write code to print type of z. Hint: The output should look something like "The value of z is 3.5 and type of z is float".

3) Type Conversion
Given x = "123", convert x to an integer.

4) Combining Strings
How do you combine the strings str1 = "Hello" and str2 = "World" to print out "Hello World"?

5) Basic Arithmetic
Given two variables a = 10 and b = 20, how do you calculate their sum and print it?

6) Basic Arithmetic
Given two variables a = 10 and b = 20, how do you calculate their product and print it?

7) Swapping Variables
How can you swap the values of two variables a = 5 and b = 10?

8) String Repetition
Given a string variable str = "Hi!", how do you print this string 3 times in a row?

9) Float Precision
Given a = 3.14159265, how do you print a with only two decimal places?

10) Multiple Assignments
How can you assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to variables a, b, and c in a single line?
